# Confluence export

This project was created to bring k15t API export feature to C#. Originally, the feature was developed in python and can be found [here](https://github.com/SPINEng/AnAutoInstaller/tree/main/ConfluenceExport).

# Next steps

1) End the tests and implement the feature to export the confluence pages.		
2) Transfer this project to AnAutoInstaller repository.
3) Update github documentation and also [confluence documentation](https://spineng.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GER/pages/269385953/Gera+o+de+instalador+Action.Net).
